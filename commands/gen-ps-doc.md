# Generate PS Knowledge Transfer Doc

Generate a Pre-Sales → PS Knowledge Transfer Google Doc by gathering live data from Glean (Salesforce + Gong), Granola (meeting notes), and Slack. The output is a Google Doc saved to the "PS Hand Over Docs" folder in Google Drive. No local files, no Notion page.

## Arguments

The user invoked this command with: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the arguments:
- **Account name** (required) — first argument, e.g. `"Grow Therapy"`. If not provided, ask the user.

**ALL SCOPING SECTIONS (General, Chat, Email, Voice) ARE ALWAYS GENERATED — every KT doc includes all sections. For channels out of scope for Phase 1, include a brief blurb about what was discussed, mark the channel as "not included in this project", and preserve the table structure with TBD values for future use.**

---

## Step 1: Identify the SC

Get the current user's name to fill the SC field in the doc:
- Call `slack_read_user_profile` with no user_id (returns current user)
- Extract `display_name` or `real_name`
- If unavailable, default to `"SC"` and continue — don't block on this

---

## Step 2: Gather Account Data (run all in parallel)

### 2a — Salesforce Opportunity (via Glean)
Query:
> "Find the open Salesforce opportunity for [account name]. Return: opportunity name, stage, ARR/amount, close date, Salesforce URL, product channels (Chat/Email/Voice), AE name, SC name, next steps, forecast category, probability, employee count, region, segmentation."

### 2b — Account Context (via Glean)
Query:
> "What do we know about [account name] as an Ada prospect or customer? Return: company overview, HQ location, timezone, tech stack (CRM, ticketing, CCaaS tools), key contacts and their roles, primary use case, secondary use cases, business drivers, known risks or blockers, API/architecture requirements, key volumes (monthly chat/email/voice conversations, number of agents), telephony provider, IVR setup, email routing system, webform presence."

### 2c — Meeting Notes (via Granola)
- Call `query_granola_meetings` with query: `"[account name] meeting notes action items demo discovery scoping chat email voice"`
- Then call `get_meetings` for the 5 most recent account-related meetings to get full details
- **Extract from these meetings: any scoping answers discussed** — email setup, voice telephony, chat volumes, tech stack, use cases, handoff requirements, APIs, authentication, routing, IVR details, success criteria

### 2d — Gong Calls AND Email Exchanges (via Glean)
Glean indexes all Gong activity — both call transcripts and email exchanges captured by Gong Engage. **Every single result returned must be checked — no skipping, no sampling.**

**Search 1 — Raw keyword search (calls and emails):**
> Use `mcp__glean__search` with query: `"[account name]"`, app filter: `"gong"`, limit: 50, sort by recency
> This returns both call recordings and email threads.
> **EXHAUSTIVE RULE: Every result returned must be individually read and mined. If 10 calls are returned, all 10 are checked. If 30 are returned, all 30 are checked. Never stop at the first few results.**
> For each result, note its title, date, and type (call transcript vs email exchange), then extract any scoping data it contains.

**Search 2 — Semantic extraction (calls and emails):**
> Use `mcp__glean__chat` with message: "From ALL Gong activity with [account name] — including every call transcript AND every email exchange — extract ALL of the following scoping details. Do not summarise across calls — give me specifics from each call and email separately: (1) Chat: monthly chat volume, current chat platform, chatbot/agent handoff setup, APIs needed, segmentation requirements; (2) Email: email system/platform, which email addresses customers contact, webform presence, email routing, AI agent email address, gradual rollout requirements, email use cases, ticketing/routing for email; (3) Voice: telephony provider, CCaaS platform, SIP integration type, current IVR setup, inbound vs outbound, call volume, agent count, missed call rate, voice use cases, DTMF requirements, SMS capabilities, handoff to human agents, routing requirements; (4) General: pain points, business drivers, tech stack, key contacts, objections, sentiment, next steps, commitments made, Gong call/email URLs. List the source (call title + date, or email subject + date) for each fact."

**After both searches, reconcile all results:**
- Build a complete list of every Gong call and email thread found (title + date + type)
- For each one, record what scoping data it contributed — even if it only confirmed something already known
- If a call or email thread yielded nothing useful, note it explicitly as "no new scoping data" — do NOT silently skip it
- Contradictions between calls (e.g. different volume numbers) must be flagged, not silently resolved — note both values and which call each came from

From the Gong results extract ALL of:
- **Chat scoping**: volumes, current platform, handoff setup, APIs, segmentation
- **Email scoping**: email system, routing, webform, AI agent email, use cases, rollout plan
- **Voice scoping**: telephony provider (Genesys? Avaya? Five9? Twilio?), CCaaS, IVR, call volumes, agent count, use cases, DTMF, SMS, routing, handoff
- **General**: pain points, tech stack, volumes, objections, sentiment, next steps, commitments made, Gong call/email URLs
- **Note**: Gong email exchanges often contain explicit scoping answers, pricing discussions, and commitments that don't appear in call transcripts — treat them as equally important

### 2e — Ada Bot (skip if no bot mentioned)
- If Glean context mentions an Ada bot or demo instance for this account:
  - Call `get_ada_configuration` — playbooks, actions, custom instructions
  - Call `get_ada_metric` for `resolution_rate` and `csat_rate` (last 7 days)

---

## Step 3: Synthesize Scoping Answers

**CRITICAL: Before building the document, do a full synthesis pass over ALL gathered data (Salesforce, Glean context, Granola meetings, Gong calls) to extract every scoping answer possible. The goal is to populate as many fields as possible with REAL data — TBD is a last resort, not a default.**

### Out-of-Scope Channel Detection
Check the Salesforce `product_channels` field and Phase 1 scoping discussions:
- If **Email is not in Phase 1 scope**: note `email_out_of_scope = True` and capture a brief summary of what was discussed (timing, platform, future phase plans)
- If **Voice is not in Phase 1 scope**: note `voice_out_of_scope = True` and capture a brief summary of what was discussed (telephony details, timeline, future phase plans)
- If a channel IS in scope: fill every table cell from data

### Chat Scoping Synthesis
- What platform do they currently use for chat? (from tech stack / Gong)
- What is their monthly chat volume? (from volumes / Gong)
- How do they currently hand off to human agents? (from Gong / Granola)
- Do they need APIs or integrations for chat? (from requirements / Gong)
- Any segmentation rules? (from Gong / Salesforce)
- What use cases are unique to chat? (from use cases discussion)

### Email Scoping Synthesis
- What email platform/system do they use? (CRM / ticketing / Gong)
- Which email address(es) do customers contact? (from Gong / Granola)
- Do they have a webform or contact form? (from Gong / website context)
- How is email currently routed? (from Gong / tech stack)
- What email address will the AI agent respond as? (from scoping discussions)
- Do they need a gradual rollout? (from Gong / risk discussions)
- What use cases are unique to email vs chat? (from use cases)
- How does email handoff to ticketing work? (from Gong / Granola)
- Any authentication requirements for email? (from API/auth discussions)

### Voice Scoping Synthesis
- Who is their telephony provider? (Genesys, Avaya, Five9, Twilio, Vonage, etc.)
- What CCaaS platform do they use? (from tech stack / Gong)
- What SIP integration type? (from Gong / technical discussions)
- What does their current IVR look like? (from Gong / Granola)
- Inbound or outbound or both? (from use cases)
- What is their call volume? (from volumes data)
- How many human agents do they have? (from Gong / Granola)
- What is their missed call rate? (from pain points / Gong)
- What is the primary voice use case? (from use cases discussion)
- Do they need DTMF / dial pad input? (from Gong / technical)
- SMS capabilities needed? (from Gong / requirements)
- How do calls hand off to human agents? (from Gong / current process)
- Any routing requirements? (from Gong / IVR discussion)

## Step 4: Build the Google Doc Content

**CRITICAL: This is a structured scoping form — NOT a narrative brief. Use the exact table structure below. Every table cell must be filled with REAL data extracted from Gong, Granola, and Glean. TBD is only for fields where no data was found anywhere. The Chat, Email, and Voice scoping tables are the most important part of this document.**

**FORMATTING RULES — always apply these when writing the doc content:**
- **Multi-item table cells** (contacts, use cases, APIs, risks, tech stack items, languages): each item must be on its own line using `<br>` to separate items within a table cell. Never write them as a comma-separated inline list when there are 2+ items.
- **Numbered lists** (KEY NEXT STEPS, any ordered sequence): always use `1.`, `2.`, `3.` on separate lines with a blank line before the list starts. Never inline numbered items.
- **Bullet lists** (Gong highlights — pain points, use cases, objections, tech mentions): always use `-` on separate lines with a blank line before the list starts. Never inline bullet items.
- **Meeting notes** (MEETING NOTES section): each meeting gets its own block — bold title + date on one line, then the summary on the next line(s). Separate meetings with a blank line.
- **Project Scope field**: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 each on a new line using `<br>` — e.g. `Phase 1: [use case]<br>Phase 2: [use case]<br>Phase 3: [use case]`
- **Key client stakeholders field**: one contact per line using `<br>` — e.g. `John Smith — VP Engineering<br>Jane Doe — Head of CX`

Construct the full document content as Markdown. Substitute ALL placeholders with real data before creating the doc.

## Step 5: Create the Google Doc

**This step is MANDATORY — always run it, every time. Do NOT skip it or ask the user.**

### 5a — Find the "PS Hand Over Docs" folder
Use the Google Workspace MCP to find the folder ID for "PS Hand Over Docs" in Google Drive:
```
google-workspace: search Drive for folder named "PS Hand Over Docs"
```

### 5b — Create the Google Doc
Use `import_to_google_doc` to create the document with the full Markdown content from Step 4, placed in the "PS Hand Over Docs" folder:
```
import_to_google_doc({
  title: "PS Handoff — [Account Name] — [YYYY-MM-DD]",
  content: "[full markdown content from Step 4 with all real data substituted in]",
  folderId: "[PS Hand Over Docs folder ID from 5a]"
})
```

Save the returned Google Doc URL.

---

## Step 6: Report Back to the User

Tell the user:
1. ✅ Google Doc URL (clickable link)
2. **Data Sources Audit** — a structured breakdown of where each piece of data came from. This is mandatory every run so the SC can validate what was found and what wasn't.

### Data Sources Audit format

After the Google Doc link, output the following audit block:

```
## 📋 Data Sources Audit — [Account Name]

### ✅ Salesforce (via Glean)
- [List each field populated: e.g. "SFDC Opp URL — found", "ARR — found ($X)", "Close Date — found", "AE Name — found", "Channels — found (Chat + Voice)"]
- ❌ [Any fields not found — e.g. "Stage — not found"]

### ✅ Account Context (via Glean)
- [List each field populated: e.g. "Company Overview — found", "HQ — found", "Timezone — found", "Tech Stack — found (Zendesk, Twilio)", "Key Contacts — found (X contacts)", "Business Drivers — found"]
- ❌ [Any fields not found]

### ✅ Gong Call Transcripts (via Glean)
- Calls found: [N] — ALL [N] were checked (list every call: title + date)
- For each call, one line: "[Call Title] ([Date]) — [what it contributed, or 'no new scoping data']"
- ❌ [Fields not found in any call — e.g. "Email routing — not mentioned in any call"]
- ⚠️ [Any contradictions between calls — e.g. "Call volume: 10k/mo in Jan call vs 15k/mo in Feb call — used Feb as more recent"]

### ✅ Gong Email Exchanges (via Glean)
- Email threads found: [N] — ALL [N] were checked (list every thread: subject + date)
- For each thread, one line: "[Subject] ([Date]) — [what it contributed, or 'no new scoping data']"
- ❌ Not found / No email exchanges indexed — [if nothing returned]

### ✅ Granola Meeting Notes
- Meetings found: [N] — ALL [N] were checked (list every meeting: title + date)
- For each meeting, one line: "[Meeting Title] ([Date]) — [what it contributed, or 'no new scoping data']"
- ❌ [Fields not found in any meeting]

### ✅ Slack Profile
- SC Name: [name found or "defaulted to SC"]

### ⚠️ Fields Left as TBD
List every field in the final doc that is still TBD, grouped by section:
- **General**: [field names]
- **Chat**: [field names]
- **Email**: [field names]
- **Voice**: [field names]
```

Keep the audit factual and specific — name the actual call title or meeting where a key fact was found. This helps the SC know exactly what to validate.

---

## Important Notes

- **No local files** — do not generate a .docx or save anything locally. The Google Doc is the only output.
- **No Notion page** — do not publish to Notion. Google Doc only.
- **ALL scoping sections are always included** — General, Chat, Email, and Voice every time. Never skip a section.
- **Out-of-scope channels**: When email or voice is not in Phase 1 scope, add the notes summary + ⚠️ callout above the table, and leave table rows as TBD.
- **Fill from data, not TBD** — For in-scope channels, every table cell should be populated from Gong, Granola, or Glean. TBD is only for genuinely unknown fields.
- **The scoping tables are the most important part of this document** — Chat, Email, and Voice scoping tables are what PS uses to build the implementation. In-scope tables must be filled.
- **Always create the Google Doc (Step 5)** — mandatory, no exceptions.
- **Never hallucinate** account details — TBD is always better than a wrong answer.
- **Gong via Glean** — there is no standalone Gong MCP; use `mcp__glean__search` with `app: "gong"` and `mcp__glean__chat` to search indexed Gong transcripts. If Glean doesn't return Gong results, note it as TBD — don't skip the attempt.
- **Gong data enriches scoping fields directly** — extract telephony provider, email system, chat platform, volumes, IVR setup, use cases, handoff process from Gong transcripts and put them into the correct scoping table cells.
